# Single-camera Multi Object Tracking using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates multi-object tracking by combining the **YOLOv8** object detector with the **DeepSORT** tracker.

## Result Example

## Features
- Object detection using YOLOv8  
- Appearance-based tracking with DeepSORT  
- Color-coded bounding boxes with track IDs and confidence scores  
- Easy integration: swap in other YOLO weights or DeepSORT feature encoders  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- OpenCV 4.x  
- NumPy  

## Acknowledgement
Our work is based on the codebase of DeepSORT:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort.git
